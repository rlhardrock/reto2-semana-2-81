                            <p class="card-text">In developed countries the primary sector has become more technologically advanced, enabling for example the mechanization of farming, as compared with hand-picking and -planting in poorer countries. More developed economies may invest additional capital in primary means of production. In other words, Big Data provides agriculture with the ability to move faster, more efficiently, solve certain problems, and identify new opportunities.
